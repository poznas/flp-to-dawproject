# FL Studio to Cubase Migration Tool

## Overview
A Python-based tool to accurately transfer audio arrangements from FL Studio to Cubase while preserving clip positions, colors, and organization across multiple arrangements. Uses "DAWProject" as an intermediate format for debugging and validation.

## Objectives
- Maintain precise clip positions and timing
- Preserve color coding for visual organization
- Support multiple arrangements with folder structure
- Automate the export process to minimize manual work
- Handle large projects (~1000 clips) efficiently
- Enable easy troubleshooting of conversion issues

## Technical Stack
- Core: Python 3.8+
- FL Studio Project Parsing: PyFLP library
- Audio Processing: Direct file operations
- Export Format: DAWProject
- Project Structure: Directory-based with arrangement folders

## Core Features

### 1. FL Studio Project Parsing
- Parse .flp files using PyFLP
- Extract clip metadata:
  - Position information
  - Color coding
  - Names (simplified to last component)
  - Length/duration
  - Arrangement association
- Generate detailed debug logs during parsing

### 2. Audio Export System
- Batch audio file export
- Maintain original audio quality
- Preserve exact clip boundaries
- Support for multiple arrangements
- Audio file validation and verification

### 3. DAWProject Generation
- Create DAWProject files containing:
  - Clip positions
  - Color information
  - Track organization
  - Timing metadata
  - Audio file references
  - Debug information
- DAWProject should contain all arrangements

### 4. File Organization
- Create organized folder structure:
```
output/
  ├── sample_project.dawproject
  └── ...
```

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Set up PyFLP project parsing
2. Implement basic audio file extraction
3. Create folder structure management
4. Add comprehensive logging system
5. Implement DAWProject schema definition

### Phase 2: DAWProject Generation
1. Implement DAWProject metadata generation
2. Add clip position mapping
3. Integrate color preservation
4. Create track organization structure
5. Add debugging information
6. Validate DAWProject against schema

### Phase 3: Debugging & Validation
1. Add parser debug logs
2. Implement metadata validation
3. Create conversion verification tools
4. Add data integrity checks
5. Generate human-readable debug output

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Batch processing for large projects
- Efficient memory usage for 1000+ clips
- Progress tracking for long operations
- DAWProject generation optimization

### Error Handling
- Validate FL Studio project structure
- Check for missing audio files
- Handle corrupt project files
- Provide clear error messages
- Generate detailed debug logs

### Debug Features
- Detailed parsing logs
- Conversion step tracking
- Data validation reports
- Error location identification
- XML formatting for readability

### Compatibility
- Support FL Studio 20.8+ project format
- Compatible with Cubase Pro 14
- Handle various audio formats
- XML schema versioning

## Future Expansion Possibilities
1. GUI interface for easier operation
2. Additional export formats
3. Custom naming scheme configuration
4. Batch project processing
5. Enhanced debugging tools
6. Real-time conversion monitoring
7. Advanced error recovery options

## Known Limitations
1. FL Studio's limited API access requires parsing workarounds
2. Need to handle large project sizes carefully
3. DAWProject file size may grow with project complexity
